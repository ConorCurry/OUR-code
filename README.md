## Scripts included

###Roster comparison
Takes bolded names from a excel spreadsheet using libreoffice uno api 
for python and presents them to a user who will compare the names with 
another list of names. Provides easy name search functionality, and 
saves the names that weren't encountered during the comparison phase to 
another file.

TODO make updating the data easier, instead of having to re-enter all 
the names. Technicallly the remainder list could be used for this 
purpose.
